random notes / log

25TH SEPTEMBER
- Discussed optimal time vs response, see also: http://nih.academia.edu/PeterBandettini/Papers/232419/Detection_Versus_Estimation_In_Event-Related_FMRI_Choosing_the_Optimal_Stimulus_Timing

- Discuss preprocessing data (by using the matlab functions) to avg ROI and compare results, so that we may compare between subjects (region may better represent than voxels?)
    - Should help for classifying multiple subjects, but not for one single subject

- Tried some running, comparing outcomes.
- What is actually the 'expected' class? We should only classify scans that are equal to 1st/2nd stimulus index\


26TH SEPTEMBER
- added some basic scoring function to log our results
- tried to use avg+stddev on regions. Train on 3 subjects, then classify another subject. Only using scan ~17 and ~37 (assuming the optimal response is in there). Results are quite mediocre, approximating a 50/50 result.
- next up: try the given functions from the project

September 28th
- added mapping between xyz and indices so that we can compare similar voxels from subject

October 2nd
- continued on prepping subject data to compare single voxels. Made some performance improvements.
- experiments we want to do:
    - Single voxel cross-subject
    - ROI cross subject
    - Leave-one-out

    Steps for current experiment:
    - Train on list of subjects
        - Extract voxels to use (creating a list for each subject)
        - Train trial/scans
    - Classify another subject
        - How to extract voxels!!? Should do this beforehand for intersecting non-zero and aligning with training data. This is ugly... even worse, we should not remove training data because test data is zero... instead, maybe keep a list after training and use that to intersect test data?

- Looked at some imagery of our data, make sure to put some in the report
- 1 by 1 comparison seems a bit silly, since xyz does not always map to same region voxels
