random notes

25th september (practical)
- Discussed optimal time vs response, see also: http://nih.academia.edu/PeterBandettini/Papers/232419/Detection_Versus_Estimation_In_Event-Related_FMRI_Choosing_the_Optimal_Stimulus_Timing

- Discuss preprocessing data (by using the matlab functions) to avg ROI and compare results, so that we may compare between subjects (region may better represent than voxels?)
    - Should help for classifying multiple subjects, but not for one single subject

- Tried some running, comparing outcomes.
