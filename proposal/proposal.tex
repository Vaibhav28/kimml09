\section{Introduction}

This project is about classifying fMRI data in order to detect the cognitive states associated with viewing different stimuli. Specifically, viewing sentences versus viewing pictures will evoke different patterns of activity in the brain. By using classifiers we will try to capture these patterns by predicting which stimuli a participant is looking at, based on the brain activity during that time.

\section{Application}

Explain how you get data or simulator, how many examples, how many inputs, outputs, whether it is an RL, classification, or regression problem.

\section{Methods}

Explain the methods that you will compare. Identify the learning algorithm and the optimisation method.

\section{Setup of Experiments}

Participants performed an experiment while laying in an fMRI scanner. The experiment consisted of sets of trials where participants were shown a first stimulus for four seconds, then a blank screen for another four seconds, and then a second stimulus for four seconds, which was followed by a rest period of 15 seconds. For the first half of the trials, a picture was used as first stimulus and a sentence was used as second stimulus, while the second half of trials showed a sentence as the first stimulus and a picture as the second. Participants had four seconds after the second stimulus appeared to indicate that the sentence and picture belonged together, after which the stimulus disappeared. If participants did not press a button the stimulus would disappear after four seconds.

\section{Programming Language}

We have chosen to implement our classification algorithms using Python. To be specific,  the well-known SciPy library. SciPy is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering and offers similar functionality compared to MatLab. Even though our datasets have been stored in MatLab's \textit{.mat} format, SciPy can work with this as well.

The main motivation for choosing Python over MatLab is our familiarity with Python, its performance and its clean coding style. As an added benefit, anyone is able to reproduce our classification results even if they don't own a MatLab license. 

Note that in the end, the specific choice is trivial with respect to our results. Both MatLab and Python (with some added libraries) support similar functionality.

\section{Planning}

Describe the different phases and the planning deadlines (until November)
